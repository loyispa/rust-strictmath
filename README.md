# rust-strictmath
If obtaining a completely predictable result is more important than running speed, then the crate should be used. This crate provides series of float functions to ensure they could produce the same results across different platforms. These algorithms are available from the well-known  **fdlibm**. 

# functions
- acos
- asin
- atan
- atan2
- cbrt
- cos
- cosh
- exp
- expm1
- hypot
- log
- log10
- log1p
- pow
- sin
- sinh
- sqrt
- tan
- tanh

# usage

Run the following Cargo command in your project directory:
```
cargo add rust-strictmath
```


Or add the following line to your Cargo.toml:
```
rust-strictmath = "0.1.2"
